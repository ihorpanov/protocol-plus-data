# Protocol+ Data Repository

>This repository contains JSON data for the Protocol+ mobile app, designed for patrol police officers. During the MVP stage, the app fetches this data directly from GitHub. In the future, data will be migrated to another backend solution.

---
*This repository is for data only. The main Protocol+ app code is located elsewhere.*
